# tidaltails
Numerically solving orbital differential equations to model the formation of tidal tails in interacting galaxies.

initfuncs.py used to set up the masses  
orbitfuncs.py used to solve the differential equations  
testingfuncs.py for analysing the system  
plotfuncs.py for generating plots of the masses  
main.py to set up initial parameters and run the simulation
